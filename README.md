# Galaxyassignments 2 & 3

1.The 'assign2.2.ipynb' is my result for assignment 2--question 2. 
 I plotted stars from Hipparcos catalogue as the background, in order to show the location of the brightest 20 stars in the main sequence. More than half of the brightest 20 stars are in the main sequence. Fraction of the stars on the main sequence versus in a post-main sequence phase is 13/7. Most of them are massive stars with mass more bigger than the Sun. Stars spend most of their life time in the main sequence.

2.The 'LumF&MasF.ipynb' is result for assignment 2--question 3. I ploted the figure of luminosity function (the first picture) and initial mass function (the second one).

3.The 'galspec-0549','galspec-0414,''galspec-0126' are my answer of assignments 3--question 1 a).
  'SpecA0iii', 'SpecB1i', 'SpecF8i', 'SpecG5i', 'SpecK4i', 'SpecM1v' are my answer of assignments 3, question 1 b).
  'comb of galaxy spec.ipynb' is result to Question 1 c). I combined several spectrum of stars in different fractions in order     
  to fake a red galaxy and a blue galaxy.
  d) The first (red one) should be an old 'galaxy' consist of more M and K type stars. 
  The second (blue) one should be a young 'galaxy' with more young stars in it. 
  The red lines in both pictures show a galaxy with higher matelicity, and the blue lines are galaxies with lower matelicity.

4.The 'Untitled1.ipynb' is my result for assignment3--problem 2. I did this together with Yuanqi Liu and Mengmeng Zhang as a group.

5.The file 'colorevolution.ipynb' is my result for assignment3--problem 3. The first figure is for 3a) and the second figure is for 3b).
